Whenever we create a JavaScript function, JavaScript adds a prototype property to that function. A prototype is an object, 
where it can add new variables and methods to the existing object.
it make easily self function.

why we use prototype--> Prototypes allow you to easily define methods to all instances of a particular object.
 The beauty is that the method is applied to the prototype, so it is only stored in the memory once, but every instance of the object has access to it.
