difference between --> oops and function programming

1--> oops mein property and function dono hote h but FP m only function hote h 
ex--oops
class A{
    a=1;
    b=2;
    c=3;
}
add(){
    return d=a+b
}
sub(){
    return d=a-b;
}

ex--FP
function (){
    var a=10;
    var b=21;
    var d=a+b
    return d;
}
function b(){
    var a=12;
    var b=23
    var c=a-b;
    return c
}

///////////////////////////
In OOP, the fundamental basis is classes, instances of which can be stored in variables. In functional programming, however, 
there are no variables; there are functions and functions only.

functional programming relies on functions, whereas object-oriented programming is based on classes and respective objects. A function is a process that retrieves a data input, processes it, and then returns an output. Therefore, functions are modules of code written to achieve a certain task.
