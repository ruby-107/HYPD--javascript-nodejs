Morph = forms
polymorphism = many forms

polymorphism is the abilty to create a variable, a function , or an object that has more than one form.


A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. 
Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband and an employee.

Why do we use polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 
In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
