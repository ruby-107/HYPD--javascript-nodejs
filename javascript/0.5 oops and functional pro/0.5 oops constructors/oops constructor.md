oops is a object oriented programming language. oops is a programming paradim (paradiam means write on code style)

object instances are created with constructor ,which are bascially special function that prepare new instance of an object for use.

constructor function b ek normal function hota h but call karane ka way thoda different hota h constructor m .

real life ex-->suppose home m ek bulb laga hua h to usko har koi easily use kar sake 

when make a constructor i am using this keyword and write a all properties inside the constructor. 

why are use --> becoz do not write many times property and only one time write the property and easily access to all method.
and ek constructor bnakar different 2 object bnakar properties ko use kar sakte h hum
