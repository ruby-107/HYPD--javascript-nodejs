An optimized code is a combination of smartly programmed logics and small hacks to optimize performance, speed and save time.

it has two types-- inline classes
                   hidden classes

How do you write an optimized code?
Unroll small loops: Most of the times Compiler does this automatically, but it is a good habit of writing optimized codes. ...
Avoid calculations in loop: We should avoid any calculation which is more or less constant in value. ...

When should you optimize code?
A program may be optimized so that it becomes a smaller size, consumes less memory, executes more rapidly, or performs fewer input/output operations. The basic requirements optimization methods should comply with, is that an optimized program must have the same output and side effects as its non-optimized version
