hum two types se programming kar sakte h isme ek imperative and declarative

Imperative --> You will tell computer how to do somethings and as a result what you want to happen.
ex--> isme ek array lenge ,loop use karege or data store karge y imperative way h
advantage--> each n every line ka access hota h kese karna h kya karna h
disadvantage  --> isme no of lines jyda use hoti h 

Declartive --> It simple means telling the machine what you whould like to happen and letting the machine figure out how to do it.
Declartive way m higher order function use karte h sirf intruction karge y karna h 

advantage--> isme only bta rhe h kese kya karna h 
disadvantage--> less no of lines use hoti h
