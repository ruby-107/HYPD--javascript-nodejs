A function is said to be idempotent if it returns the same output for the same input or does what we expect it to do. Idempotence is different from pure function as it allows side effects. An example could be calling an API with an input and returning the same output no matter how many times it has been called.

ex-- get , put, delete method are idemopent and create are unidemopent


What is a example of idempotent?

On/Off buttons of a train's destination sign control panel. Pressing the On button (green) is an idempotent operation,
 since it has the same effect whether done once or multiple times. Likewise, pressing Off is idempotent
